# Mozilla Science Lab Global Sprint 2016

The [survey results](Open_Science_101/meetings/2016-06-02-Mozilla_Science_Lab_Global_Sprint_2016/Topic_survey/OS101_topic_voting_2016-06-03_11:00.csv) suggested the topics to look at are
* Open Data (21 votes)
* Incentives for Open Science (16 votes)
* Open Source (15 votes)
* Open Licenses (14 votes)

As all topics are related to the research cycle in science, it was decided that a chapter on the research cycle should be added that will serve as a general introduction leading over all the topics (with a research cycle diagram). This introductory chapter will also cover incentives for Open Science from the researcher's perspective.
* What are the benefits for me if I practice Open Science?
* pros and cons of Open Science ("scooping" ...)
Other discussions of incentives will not be included yet as they will require adding additional stakeholder personas (decisionmaker, like politicians/funding agencies) which is outside of the scope of this project for now.

The [Open Source topic discussion](https://github.com/OKScienceDE/Open_Science_101/issues/30) led to the decision that as this topic is of interest to a more specialised audience. Thus, Open Access, a topic of general interest, will be covered first.

The topics that will be worked on hence are:
* the research cycle (incl. diagram)
* Open Data
* Open Access
* Open Licenses

To facilitate the work, a markdown template will be created that can be easily exported into PDF handouts etc. for teaching.

A name change to "Open Science Carpentry" has been discussed and a mail explaining this consideration has been sent to the [Software Carpentry mailing list](http://lists.software-carpentry.org/listinfo/discuss). The final email text is exported from the [etherpad](https://pad.okfn.org/p/OpenScience101MailSoftwareCarpentry) to the file [OpenScience101MailSoftwareCarpentry.txt](OpenScience101MailSoftwareCarpentry.txt).
