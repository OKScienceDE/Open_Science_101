# Survey

## General
In order to get a feeling which Open Science related topic should be
first adressed we set up a survey and also asked people to give
feedback via the issues at GitHub.

The final version of [the etherpad with topics and short descriptions](https://pad.okfn.org/p/OpenScience101topicsuggestions) can be found in [OpenScience101topicsuggestions.md](OpenScience101topicsuggestions.md).

The survey was started and send to communities at Thursday 2016-06-02.

## Results
The first set of results was taken at 2016-06-03 11:00 and stored in
the file [OS101_topic_voting_2016-06-03_11:00.csv](OS101_topic_voting_2016-06-03_11:00.csv).
This file has been updated at 2016-06-03 15:00 due to a bug in the github api script.

The script to generate the counts from the github api is [get_upvote_counts_from_github.sh](get_upvote_counts_from_github.sh)
