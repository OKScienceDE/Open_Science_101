In order to get a feeling which Open Science related topic should be
first adressed we set up a survey and also asked people to give
feedback via the issues at GitHub.

The survey was started and send to communities at Thursday 2016-06-02.
The first set of results was taken at 2016-06-03 11:00 and stored in
the file `OS101_topic_voting_2016-06-03_11:00.csv`.
