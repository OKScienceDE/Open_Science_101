# Personas and Pathways

Here we define potential users and contributors and how they fit
into this project. For further information we would like to refer you to
this [document which explains the purpose of
personas](https://mozillascience.github.io/working-open-workshop/personas_pathways/).

## Users

### Ida (lecturer)

Ida is a researcher in life sciences working on fruit fly
genetics. For several years she has been part of the Open Science
community and has been very active there. Besides that she likes modern art,
Jazz music, and tries to get into soldering in her local hack space.

She would like to teach an Open Science class but she knows
establishing such a course from scratch requires a lot of work which
she cannot squeeze into her tight schedule. Ida does a search on the web for
potential material and finds **Open Science 101**. As this reduces the
preparation effort for her dramatically she decides to offer an
"Introduction to Open Science" class. After each lecture given she reports
back to the **Open Science 101** team and points out if there is any material 
that is missing or that needs improvement.

### Nick (student)

Nick is a student of Physics and will soon start his Master in
semi-conductor quantum mechanics. While talking to a PhD student during
an intership he heard about problems in the way science is
currently being conducted. He was informed that there is an Open Science movement that
would like to change how science is performed and he got interested in
learning how he could apply these principles to his research.

He finds a course about Open Science at his university that is given by
Ida. Ida invites the participants of the course to give feedback to
the **Open Science 101** project. Nick creates a GitHub account and
generates several issues where he suggests how the material could be
improved.

### Natalia (citizien scientist / interested lay person)

Natalia works as a lawyer at a large company. At some point she
recognized, inspired by the books of Carl Sagan, how much fun
science and engineering can be. Because of this she started some small
science projects in her spare time on her own. 

On Twitter she stumbles accross a link to the **Open Science 101** project
and reads the material of the different topics. Based on the newly
aquired knowledge she makes her small science project open and connects to the
Open Science community by joining the OKFN Open Science mailing
list. Some months later she gives a lightning talk about Open Science
at a maker fair in her town. She uses some graphics and material taken
from the **Open Science 101** project. While preparing, she spots a typo in
the material and writes an email to the maintainer of the material.
