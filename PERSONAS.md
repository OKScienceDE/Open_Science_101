# Personas and Pathways

Here we define potential users and contributers and how they can fit
into this project. For further information we would like to refer to
this [document which explains the purpose of
personas](https://mozillascience.github.io/working-open-workshop/personas_pathways/).

## Users

### Ida (lecturer)

Ida is a researcher in life sciences working on fruit fly
genetics. Since several years she has been part of the Open Science
community and is very active there. Besides that she like modern art,
Jazz music, and tries to get into soldering in her local hack space.

She would like to teach an Open Science class but she knows
establishing such a course from scratch requires a lot of work which
she cannot squeez into her tight schedule. Ida searches the web for
potential material and finds **Open Science 101**. As this reduces the
preparation effort for her dramatically she desides to offer a class
"Introduction to Open Science". After each lecture given she reports
back to the **Open Science 101** team and points out material that is
missing or that still need improvements.

### Nick (student)

Nick is a student of Physics and will soon start his Master in
semi-conductor quantum mechanics. When talking to a PhD student during
an intership he heard about problems in the current way science is
conducted. He was informed that there is an Open Science movement that
would like to change how science is performed and he got interested in
learnig how he could apply these principles to his research.

He finds a course about Open Science at his university that is given by
Ida. Ida invites the participants of the course to give feedback to
the **Open Science 101** project. Nick creates a GitHub account and
generates several issues where he suggests how the material could be
improved.

### Natalia (citizien scientist / interested lay person)

Natalia works as a lawyer at a larger company. At some point she
recognized, inspired by books of Carl Sagan, how much fun
science and engineering can be. Due to this she started some small
science projects in her spare time on her own. 

On Twitter she stumbles accross a link to the **Open Science 101** project
and reads the material of the different topics. Based on the newly
aquired knowledge she makes her small project open and connects to the
Open Science community by joining the OKFN Open Science mailing
list. Some months later she gives a lightning talk about Open Science
at a maker fair in her town. She uses some graphics and material taken
from the **Open Science 101** project. While preparing, she spots a typo in
the material and writes an email to the maintainer of the material.
