## General Problem

The principles and [facets of Open Science](https://github.com/OKScienceDE/Facettes_of_Open_Science/blob/master/facettes_of_open_science.png) have become increasingly
noted throughout the last couple of years. However, whereas Open
Access has gained quite a lot of visibility, other facets are hardly
visible and even less in action. In fact, many of the facets and
principles are mainly known to those who are interested in working
openly anyway. Fostering (facets of) Open Science should not only be
a case of "preaching to the converted", but to give anybody an
understanding of the concepts, principles, opportunities and challenges
of the related subjects.

## Aim

This project aims to generate high quality, concise teaching materials
of Open Science principles. The target audience are teachers who would
like to build courses based on the material, students and researcher
who would like to get quickly an overview of core Open Science
concepts as well as anybody interested in Open Science. The materials
are available under the [CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain
Dedication](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)
license to facilitate optimal reusability.

This compendium aims to include documentation of the [different facets
of Open
Science](https://github.com/OKScienceDE/Facettes_of_Open_Science/blob/master/facettes_of_open_science.png)
like Open Access, Open Data, Open Licenses, Open Peer Review etc. Our
definition of Open Science is very broad - it also covers the opening
of the humanities as well as Open Educational Resources and other
related topics.

There are quite a number of approaches how this can be undertaken and
a number of projects doing this for either certain topics or certain
target groups. However, there does not seem to be a concerted approach.

For a more detailed description of our target audience as well as
potential contributors we would like to refer to our [personas
file](PERSONAS.md).

_"Open Science 101" is the current working title and might be changed
in the future dependent on the actual content._

### What we DON'T want to achieve

The outcome of this project shall be more than merely a collection of
resources (e.g. tools) supporting or Open Science within different
disciplinary contexts. This is for two reasons:

1. Such a collection - in the most basic form this could be a list,
in a more sophisticated form this could be a database - would be very
difficult to maintain as old tools and services are discontinued or new
tools arise in quite a rapid manner.
2. Such a collection would be quite extensive in its scope and would
quickly become long and more difficult to handle for interested users. In
addition many of the listed tools and services might be mainly relevant to
specific contexts (disciplines), but not very useful in others. This might
limit the usefulness of the collection itself.

However, there are attempts to do such a thing (blogposts, wiki lists, etc.).

### What we DO want to achieve

Instead, we want to come up with a set of educational resources that
provide usable teaching material elaborating on the basic principles of Open
Science that most of the different contexts (e.g. disciplines), if not all,
have in common.

This material can then be easily adapted (e.g. forked) and complemented by
domain-specific tools, regulations, or any other particular topics.

Over time, this will hopefully build an extended variety of educational materials
that can be used for many different contexts.

## Current Status

_Current Status: IN PREPARATION_

Currently we are [collecting ideas](https://github.com/OKScienceDE/Open_Science_101/issues)
about the scope via the issue tracker and would invite everybody to
contribute to the discussion and to share ideas.

Our role models for this repository are Software Carpentry (http://software-carpentry.org/)
and Data Carpentry (http://www.datacarpentry.org/). Both initiatives host
all their teaching material publicly in GitHub repositories so the content
can be easily crowd-sourced (see e.g. http://software-carpentry.org/lessons/).
We will try to adhere to their style as far as this is suitable.

We are aware that this is not the first attempt to generate such a
collection, but in our opinion, there is no comprehensive resource
covering all the required topics.

## Contributing

We're happy to invite you to contribute, [please have a look](https://github.com/OKScienceDE/Open_Science_101/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
to see how and where! We expect of all participants to follow our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/OKScienceDE/Open_Science_101/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

### Mozilla Science Lab Global Sprint 2016 (2nd - 3rd June, 2016)

At the currently ongoing [Mozilla Science Lab Global Sprint 2016](https://www.mozillascience.org/global-sprint-2016)
-- an event with local and virtual meetings -- we are working on the
compendium. Again, you are invited to join us (which you can announce here:
https://github.com/mozillascience/global-sprint-2016/issues/36).

For the two-day sprint, we've created a [milestone](https://github.com/OKScienceDE/Open_Science_101/milestones/Mozilla%20Science%20Global%20Sprint%202016)
that contains the issues we want to particularly concentrate on within the sprint - these
are also good starting points if you want to join!

There will be two sites where we will be available in person during the sprint:

1. On Thursday [Matthias](http://github.com/matthiasfromm) will be at the sprint-site in [Berlin](https://ti.to/mozilla-science/gs2016-berlin)
2. On Friday [Andreas](https://github.com/aleimba) and [Konrad](https://github.com/konrad) will be available at the [University of WÃ¼rzburg](https://www.uni-wuerzburg.de/en/ueber/university/) (exact location to be announced soon)

Further information including how to join us remotely can be found in
**[this etherpad](https://pad.okfn.org/p/OpenScience101MozillaScienceLabGlobalSprint)** and our [meeting documentation](./meetings/2016-06-02-Mozilla_Science_Lab_Global_Sprint_2016/).
