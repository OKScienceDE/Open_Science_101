## General Problem

The principles and facets of open science have become increasingly
noted throughout the last couple of years. However, whereas Open
Access has gained quite a lot of visibility, other facets are hardly
visible and even less in action. In fact, many of the facets and
principles are mainly known to those who are interested in working
openly anyway. Fostering (facets of) Open Science should not only be
a case of "preaching to the converted", but to give anybody an
understanding of the concepts, principles, opportunities and challenges
of the related subjects.

## Aim

There are quite a number of approaches how this can be undertaken and
a number of projects doing this for either certain topics or certain
target groups. However, there does not seem to be a concerted approach.

This compendium aims to include documentation of the [different facets of Open Science](https://github.com/aleimba/Facettes_of_Open_Science/blob/master/facettes_of_open_science.png)
like Open Access, Open Data, Open Source, and Open Peer Review
(see Facettes of Open Science). Our definition of Open Science is very
broad - it also covers the opening of the humanities as well as
Open Educational Resources and other related topics.

_"Open Science 101" is the current working title and might be changed
in the future dependent on the actual content._

### What we DON'T want to achieve

The outcome of this project shall be more than merely a collection of
resources (e.g. tools) supporting or Open Science within different
disciplinary contexts. This is for two reasons:

1. Such a collection - in the most basic form this could be a list,
in a more sophisticated form this could be a database - would be very
difficult to maintain as old tools and services are discontinued or new
tools arise in quite a rapid manner.
2. Such a collection would be quite extensive in its scope and would
quickly become long and more difficult to handle for interested users. In
addition many of the listed tools and services might be mainly relevant to
specific contexts (disciplines), but not very useful in others. This might
limit the usefulness of the collection itself.

However, there are attemts to do such a thing (blogposts, wiki lists, etc.).

### What we DO want to achieve

Instead we want to come up with a set of educational resources that
provide usable teaching material elaborating the basic principles of Open
Science that most of the different contexts (e.g. disciplines), if not all,
have in common.

This material can then be easily adapted (e.g. forked) and complemented by
e.g. domain-specific tools, regulations, or any other particular topics.

Over time, this would hopefully build an extended variety of educational material
for many different contexts.

## Current Status

_Current Status: IN PREPARATION_

Currently we are [collecting ideas](https://github.com/OKScienceDE/Open_Science_101/issues)
about the scope via the issue tracker and would invite everybody to
contribute to the discussion and to share ideas.

Our role models for this repository are Software Carpentry (http://software-carpentry.org/)
and Data Carpentry (http://www.datacarpentry.org/). Both initiatives host
all their teaching material public in GitHub repositories so the content
can be easily crowd-sourced (see e.g. http://software-carpentry.org/lessons/).
We will try to adhere to their style as far as this is suitable.

We are aware that this is not the first attempt to generate such a
collection but in our opinion there is no comprehensive resource
covering all the required topics.

### Mozilla Science Lab Global Sprint 2016 (2nd - 3rd June, 2016)

At the upcoming [Mozilla Science Lab Global Sprint 2016](https://www.mozillascience.org/global-sprint-2016)
-- an event with local and virtual meetings -- we will work on the
compendium. Again, you are invited to join us (which you can announce here:
https://github.com/mozillascience/global-sprint-2016/issues/36).

For the two days sprint we've created a [milestone](https://github.com/OKScienceDE/Open_Science_101/milestones/Mozilla%20Science%20Global%20Sprint%202016)
that contains the issues we want to particularly concentrate on within the sprint
- these are also good starting points if you want to join!

There will be two sites where we will be available in person during the sprint:

1. On Thursday Matthias will be at the sprint-site in [Berlin](https://ti.to/mozilla-science/gs2016-berlin)
2. On Friday Andreas and Konrad will be available at the [University of Würzburg](https://www.uni-wuerzburg.de/en/ueber/university/) (exact location to be announced soon)
