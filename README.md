## General Problem

The principles and [facets of Open Science](https://github.com/OKScienceDE/Facettes_of_Open_Science/blob/master/facettes_of_open_science.png) have become increasingly
noted throughout the last couple of years. However, whereas Open
Access has gained quite a lot of visibility, other facets are hardly
apparent and seen even less in action. In fact, many of the facets and
principles are mainly known and applied by those who are interested in working
openly anyway. Fostering (facets of) Open Science should not only be
a case of "preaching to the converted", but also to give anyone an
understanding of the concepts, principles, opportunities and challenges
of these related subjects.

## Aim

This project aims to generate high quality, concise teaching materials
of Open Science principles. The target audience are teachers who would
like to build courses based on this material, students and researcher
who would like to quickly get an overview of core Open Science
concepts as well as anyone that is interested in Open Science. The materials
are available under the [CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain
Dedication](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)
license to facilitate optimal reusability.

This compendium aims to include documentation of the [different facets
of Open
Science](https://github.com/OKScienceDE/Facettes_of_Open_Science/blob/master/facettes_of_open_science.png)
like: Open Access, Open Data, Open Licenses, Open Peer Review, etc. Our
definition of Open Science is very broad - it also covers the opening
of the humanities as well as Open Educational Resources and other
related topics.

There are quite a number of approaches how this can be undertaken and
a number of projects doing this for either certain topics or certain
target groups. However, there does not seem to be a concerted approach.

We are collecting existing material that's already been made to introduce
specific audiences to Open Science at
[Open Science Q&A](https://openscience.uni-bielefeld.de/898/which-materials-exist-introducing-specific-audiences-science). Many of these resources serve as templates for our material.

For a more detailed description of our target audience as well as
potential contributors we would like to refer to our [personas
file](PERSONAS.md).

_"Open Science 101" is the current working title and might be changed
in the future dependent on the actual content._

### What we DO NOT want to achieve

The outcome of this project shall be more than merely a collection of
resources (e.g. tools) supporting Open Science within different
disciplinary contexts. This is for two reasons:

1. Such a collection - in its most basic form would be a list of resources,
in a more sophisticated form this could be a database which would be very
difficult to maintain as old tools and services are discontinued or new
tools arise in quite a rapid manner.
2. Such a collection would be quite extensive in its scope and would
quickly become long and more difficult to handle for interested users. In
addition many of the tools and services listed might be relevant within
a specific context (discipline), but not very useful in others. This might
limit the general usefulness of the collection itself.

However, there are attempts to do such a thing (blogposts, wiki lists, etc.).

### What we DO want to achieve

Instead, we want to come up with a set of educational resources that
provide usable teaching material elaborating on the basic principles of Open
Science that most of the different contexts (e.g. disciplines), if not all,
have in common.

This material can then be easily adapted (e.g. forked) and complemented by
domain-specific tools, regulations, or any other particular topics.

Over time, this will hopefully build an extended variety of educational materials
that can be used for many different contexts.

## Current Status

_Current Status: IN PROGRESS (kickstarting sprint finished)_

Currently we are [collecting ideas](https://github.com/OKScienceDE/Open_Science_101/issues)
about the scope via the issue tracker and would invite anybody to
contribute to the discussion and to share ideas.

Our role models for this repository are Software Carpentry (http://software-carpentry.org/)
and Data Carpentry (http://www.datacarpentry.org/). Both initiatives host
all their teaching material publicly in GitHub repositories so the content
can be easily crowd-sourced (see e.g. http://software-carpentry.org/lessons/).
We will try to adhere to their style as far as this is suitable.

We are aware that this is not the first attempt to generate such a
collection, but in our opinion, there is no comprehensive resource
covering all the required topics.

## Contributing

We are happy to invite you to contribute, [please have a look](https://github.com/OKScienceDE/Open_Science_101/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
to see how and where! We expect of all participants to follow our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/OKScienceDE/Open_Science_101/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

### Mozilla Science Lab Global Sprint 2016 (2nd - 3rd June, 2016)

At the [Mozilla Science Lab Global Sprint 2016](https://www.mozillascience.org/global-sprint-2016)
-- an event with local and virtual meetings -- we worked on the
compendium. Here is our [project page](https://science.mozilla.org/projects/open-science-101) and
the issue for the registration of the project (https://github.com/mozillascience/global-sprint-2016/issues/36).

For the two-day sprint, we have created a
[milestone](https://github.com/OKScienceDE/Open_Science_101/milestones/Mozilla%20Science%20Global%20Sprint%202016)
that contains the issues we wanted to particularly concentrate on
within the sprint - these are also good starting points if you want to
join!

**[this etherpad](https://pad.okfn.org/p/OpenScience101MozillaScienceLabGlobalSprint)** and our [meeting documentation](./meetings/2016-06-02-Mozilla_Science_Lab_Global_Sprint_2016/).

[Matthias](http://github.com/matthiasfromm/) wrote a detailed [blog
post about the project and the
MozSprint](http://www.offene-wissenschaft.de/2016/06/open-science-101-and-my-first-mozilla-science-global-sprint-mozsprint/). [Andreas](http://github.com/aleimba),
[Markus](http://github.com/iimog) and
[Konrad](https://github.com/konrad) recorded a [podcast
episode](http://www.openscienceradio.de/2016/06/03/osr053-sprint-report-open-science-101-at-mozsprint-2016/)
about it.
