# Open Science Resources

## Introductory Materials

The best introductory reading materials are the Wikipedia pages for [Open Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science)
and [Open Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_research).  You may also want to watch Michael Neilson's
[TedX Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/michael_nielsen_open_science_now) from 2011.

There is also a summary of
[Open Training for Open Science](http://science.okfn.org/2014/12/21/open-training-for-open-science/)
from late 2014.

## Training Materials with Permissive Licenses

[Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/lessons/) provides materials and lessons for domain specific areas
including ecology, genomics, geospatial, sociology, and biology.

[Open Science Training Initiative](http://www.opensciencetraining.com/index.php).  This lecture slides and notes are
available from thier [GitHub repository](https://github.com/StilettoFiend/OpenScienceTraining).  There are also
[videos](http://www.opensciencetraining.com/movielist.php) of their 2013 lectures.

[Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/) provides videos and materials with an emphasis on version
control, MatLab, R, and Python.

## Training Services

[Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/workshops/) offers workshops.


## Other Resources

[CREP - Collaborative Replications and Education Project](https://osf.io/wfc6u/) crowdsources replication for
undergraduate researchers.   Small research awards (under 500 USD) are available.

The twitter feed [@openscience](https://twitter.com/openscience) for those developing short attention spans.

A continuing discussion of available resources on
[Quora](https://openscience.uni-bielefeld.de/898/which-materials-exist-introducing-specific-audiences-science).
