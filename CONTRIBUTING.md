## How can you contribute?

### Collecting Ideas, Reporting Bugs, Suggesting Enhancements

**Ideas:** As this project is currently in a preparation phase, the best starting point to contribute is to help us with collecting ideas and discuss them. Please feel invited to go over to the [issues section](https://github.com/OKScienceDE/Open_Science_101/issues) - you will find good starting points within the [milestones](https://github.com/OKScienceDE/Open_Science_101/milestones).

**Bugs:** If you identify any bugs, please contribute [issues](https://github.com/OKScienceDE/Open_Science_101/issues) and let us know about it. You can find [help mastering issues here](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). Please try to be as specific as you can!

**Enhancement suggestions:** If you have further ideas, please also use [issues](https://github.com/OKScienceDE/Open_Science_101/issues) to give us a note. Please make sure you've shortly looked through the existing ones to check whether your ideas are already on the table. If there is a similar idea, please consider commenting on that one and elaborate on what you would change or add!


### Participate in the Mozilla Science Lab Global Sprint 2016 (2nd - 3rd June, 2016)

At the upcoming Mozilla Science Lab Global Sprint 2016 -- an event with local and virtual meetings -- we will work on the compendium. Again, you are invited to join us (which you can announce here: https://github.com/mozillascience/global-sprint-2016/issues/36).

For the two days sprint we've created a [milestone](https://github.com/OKScienceDE/Open_Science_101/milestones/Mozilla%20Science%20Global%20Sprint%202016) that contains the issues we want to particularly concentrate on within the sprint - these are also good starting points if you want to join!

There will be two sites where we will be available in person during the sprint:

1. On Thursday Matthias will be at the sprint-site in [Berlin](https://ti.to/mozilla-science/gs2016-berlin)
2. On Friday Andreas and Konrad will be available at the [University of Würzburg](https://www.uni-wuerzburg.de/en/ueber/university/) (exact location to be announced soon)

Further information including how to join us remotely can be found in
[this etherpad](https://pad.okfn.org/p/OpenScience101MozillaScienceLabGlobalSprint).

## Further Steps: Roadmap

Over time we will develop/extent a [roadmap](https://github.com/OKScienceDE/Open_Science_101/wiki/Roadmap) that provides a bit more oversight of what the current goals are and what the next goals will be.
